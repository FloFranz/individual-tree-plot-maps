# Individual Tree Positions and Plot Maps

## Overview

This repository contains the code for calculating individual tree coordinates from polar measurements obtained during forest inventory. The methods are based on the forest inventory system of Lower Saxony, Germany, with examples demonstrated for two specific forestry offices.    
Additionally, the repository includes code for generating plot maps that visualize individual tree positions relative to the center point of each inventory plot.
